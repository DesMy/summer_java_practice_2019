		<h1>Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm Visualizer</h1>
		<h4>Author: Igor Sergeev + Nguyen Quang Huy + Nguyen Thi Thu Duyen</h4>
		<h2>About program</h2>
		<p>This program is created in the practice session for 2nd year students.
		The purpose is to get use to the programming language Java, to create a program which can visualize the calculation process of algorithm Ford-Fulkerson.
		</p>
		<h2>About the algorithm:</h2>
		<p>Fordâ€“Fulkerson algorithm (FFA) is a greedy algorithm that computes the maximum flow in a flow network. 
		The idea behind the algorithm is as follows: as long as there is a path from the source (start node) to the sink (end node), with available capacity on all edges in the path, we send flow along one of the paths. Then we find another path, and so on.
